            <p>Hi! My name is Jenny Rogers, and I am a senior at the University in Florida from Memphis, Tennessee majoring in public relations. I am also enrolled in the combined degree program, which allows me to begin taking classes toward a master's degree in web design and online communication. Given that I get into the master's program, I hope to pursue a career as a web developer, news reporter, freelance journalist or public relations professional. I especially love storytelling, whether it's a feature story or a traditional event story. I feel that I have grown into my academic voice during my time at UF, thanks to my awesome CJC classes! </p>
            <p>In my free time, I like to draw, listen to and explore music, watch movies, play chess and go to the gym. Listening to music is by far my favorite hobby. Some of my favorite artists or bands include Frank Ocean, Tyler the Creator, Eagles, Pink Floyd, The Strokes, Arctic Monekys and Cage the Elephant. I also love attending music festivals! I've been going to Beale Street Music Festival in Memphis every year since I was in the sixth grade. I have also been to Lollapalooza twice, and I plan to go to Okeechobee in March this year.</p>
